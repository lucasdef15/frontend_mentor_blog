            Iâ€™m on a journey to become a front-end web developer. I love
            building little projects, trying out new coding techniques, and
            sharing what I learn along the way. When Iâ€™m not at my desk, youâ€™ll
            find me reading, hiking through the mountains, or challenging myself
            on rock-climbing walls.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started this blog to document my progress, keep myself
            accountable, and hopefully inspire anyone else whoâ€™s learning to
            code. Welcome to my corner of the internet, and thanks for stopping
            by!
